With The Big Picture the importance of teamwork, co-operation and communication is reinforced through the process of painting an artistic masterpiece of truly epic proportions. At the start of the exercise the delegates are divided into small teams responsible for painting one or several individual canvases – each small segment of The Big Picture artwork. Armed with brushes, paint, very little information and importantly no idea what the image will be, the teams have to work with each other to ensure lines meet and colours match. Delegates soon realise, that to be successful, they have to co-operate with the other teams rather than compete. In short, they have to take a ‘big picture’ view to ensure that each canvas fits perfectly and the final result is a success. The Big Picture image can be inspired by a company’s brand, conference theme, products, values, goals or alternatively it can be a large scale reproduction of a famous work of art. Once complete, the canvases from all the teams are collected, framed together and covered. The highlight of The Big Picture is the final reveal where, following a debrief, the masterpiece is unveiled to the delegates for the first time with inevitable loud cheers and thundering applause. The completed masterpiece can be displayed back in the office as a lasting reminder of the importance of teamwork.
